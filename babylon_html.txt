    <h1>Game of Life and Bassline Generator</h1>
    <p>This is a simple web page that runs a JavaScript code to create a game of life grid and a bassline generator. The game of life is a cellular automaton that simulates the evolution of a population of cells based on some simple rules. The bassline generator is a musical algorithm that creates a sequence of notes based on the game of life grid.</p>
    <p>To run the code, click the button below. You will see a 64 x 64 grid on the canvas and hear a bassline playing on your speakers. You can also click on any cell on the grid to toggle its state and change the bassline accordingly. Have fun!</p>
    <button id="run">Run Code</button>
    <canvas id="canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    <script>
        // Add the JavaScript code for the game of life and the bassline generator here
        // See previous messages for the code
    </script>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the Run Code button to start the game of life and the bassline generator.</li>
        <li>Click on any cell on the grid to toggle its state and change the bassline accordingly.</li>
        <li>Resize the window to adjust the grid size.</li>
        <li>The first note of the bassline determines the initial pattern on the grid.</li>
        <li>The color of each cell corresponds to its note.</li>
        <li>The game of life rules are slightly randomized to add some variation.</li>
